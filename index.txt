AIM: our project is about attendance recording system using python

Requirements: ref' database, face capture, face recognition, 
            attendance recording in data files, display & anounce name as audio.

System Requirements & Design: 
1. data load modules(panda)
2. face capture module(camera using opencv)
3. face recognise module(dlib/cmake & python face-recognition)
4. attendance record module
5. display attendance module

Procedure: steps wise learning_ 
1. Introduction to Face Recognition
(we can indentify object, age, gender, state of mind,etc..)
